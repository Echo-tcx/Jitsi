    <p><strong>SIP Communicator - the Java VoIP and Instant Messaging client.</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">
    SIP Communicator 1.0 is an application that allows you (or rather would soon
    allow you ;) ) to do audio/video conversations over the Internet through the
    SIP protocol, as well as chat with your friends using some of the most
    popular instant messaging protocols such as SIP/SIMPLE, Jabber, AIM/ICQ,
    MSN, Yahoo, IRC and others.

    Note that right now the SIP Communicator is still a work in progress </strong>
    and as such is currently unusable by end users. If you are a developer and would
    like to help up you may consult the

    case you are just an eager user and would like to get notified once the
    release is available, then you might want to subscribe to

  <strong>For those looking for SIP Communicator's previous versions, please
   read the following note.</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This site, as well as
  <a href="http://sip-communicator.org">sip-communicator.org</a> are both dedicated to the development
  of SIP Communicator version 1.0. Releases made before it, (we call them Pre 1.0
  for lack of versioning) could be considered alpha have represented more of an
  experimental application rather than a fully featured communications client.
  We are all currently focusing on the development of SIP Communicator 1.0 and
  will be unable to maintain or provide any support on Pre 1.0 code. If for some
  reason however you are looking for the "old" SIP Communicator, you could find
  its source and binaries here.
