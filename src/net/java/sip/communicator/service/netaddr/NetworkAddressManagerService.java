     * To put it briefly, the issue is about choosing a local source
     * address to bind to or to distribute to peers. It is possible and even
     * quite probable to expect that a machine may dispose with multiple
     * addresses and each of them may be valid for a specific destination.
     * Example cases include:
     * <p>
     * 1) A dual stack IPv6/IPv4 box. <br>
     * 2) A double NIC box with a leg on the Internet and another one in a
     * private LAN <br>
     * 3) In the presence of a virtual interface over a VPN or a MobileIP(v6)
     * tunnel.
     * <p>
     * In all such cases a source local address needs to be chosen according to
     * the intended destination and after consulting the local routing table.
     * <p>
     * @param intendedDestination the address of the destination that we'd like
     * to access through the local address that we are requesting.
     *
     * @return an InetAddress instance representing the local host, and that
     * a socket can bind upon or distribute to peers as a contact address.
