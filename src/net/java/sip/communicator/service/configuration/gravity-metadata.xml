       This metadata file instructs the Gravity Service Binder to
       create one instance of "SpellCheckServiceImpl". It also
       tells the generic activator that this instance implements the
       "SpellCheckService" service interface and that it has an
       aggregate dependency on "DictionaryService" services. Since
       the service dependency on dictionary services has a lower
       cardinality of one, the generic activator will create the instance
       and offer its spell check service only when there is at least
       one dictionary service available. The service dependency is
       "dynamic", which means that dictionary service availability
       will be monitored dynamically at runtime and it also tells the
       generic activator which methods to call when adding and removing
       dictionary services.
