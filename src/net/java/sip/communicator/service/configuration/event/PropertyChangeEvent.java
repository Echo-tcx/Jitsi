/**
 * A "ConfigurationChange" event gets delivered whenever a someone changes a
 * configuration property.  A ConfigurationEvent object is sent as an
 * argument to the ConfigurationChangeListener methods.
 * <P>
 * Normally ConfigurationChangeEvents are accompanied by the name and the old
 * and new values of the changed property.  If the new value is a primitive
 * type (such as int or boolean) it must be wrapped as the
 * corresponding java.lang.* Object type (such as Integer or Boolean).
 * <P>
 * Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their
 * true values are not known.
 * <P>
 * An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an
 * arbitrary set of if its properties have changed.  In this case the
 * old and new values should also be null.
 * <P>
 * In the case where the event reflects the change of a constrained property,
 * it will first be dispatched to all propertyWillChange methods and only in
 * case that none of them has objected (no ChangeVetoException has been thrown)
 * the propertyChange method is called.
