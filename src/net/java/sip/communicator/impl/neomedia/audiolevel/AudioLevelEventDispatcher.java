/**
 * The class implements an audio level measurement thread. The thread will
 * measure new data every time it is added through the <tt>addData()</tt> method
 * and would then deliver it to a registered listener if any. (No measurement
 * would be performed until we have a <tt>levelListener</tt>). We use a
 * separate thread so that we could compute and deliver audio levels in a way
 * that won't delay the media processing thread.
 * <p>
 * Note that, for performance reasons this class is not 100% thread safe and you
 * should not modify add or remove audio listeners in this dispatcher in the
 * notification thread (i.e. in the thread where you were notified of an audio
 * level change).
