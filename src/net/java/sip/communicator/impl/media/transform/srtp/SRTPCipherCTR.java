/**
 * SRTPCipherCTR implements SRTP Counter Mode AES Encryption (AES-CM).
 * Counter Mode AES Encryption algorithm is defined in RFC3711, section 4.1.1.
 * 
 * Other than Null Cipher, RFC3711 defined two two encryption algorithms:
 * Counter Mode AES Encryption and F8 Mode AES encryption. Both encryption
 * algorithms are capable to encrypt / decrypt arbitrary length data, and the
 * size of packet data is not required to be a multiple of the AES block 
 * size (128bit). So, no padding is needed.
 * 
 * Please note: these two encryption algorithms are specially defined by SRTP.
 * They are not common AES encryption modes, so you will not be able to find a 
 * replacement implementation in common cryptographic libraries. 
 *
 * As defined by RFC3711: Counter Mode Encryption is mandatory..
