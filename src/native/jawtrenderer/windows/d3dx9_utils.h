/************************************************************
 * D3DXLoadSurfaceFromMemory
 *
 * Loads data from a given memory chunk into a surface,
 * applying any of the specified filters.
 *
 * PARAMS
 *   pDestSurface [I] pointer to the surface
 *   pDestPalette [I] palette to use
 *   pDestRect    [I] to be filled area of the surface
 *   pSrcMemory   [I] pointer to the source data
 *   SrcFormat    [I] format of the source pixel data
 *   SrcPitch     [I] number of bytes in a row
 *   pSrcPalette  [I] palette used in the source image
 *   pSrcRect     [I] area of the source data to load
 *   dwFilter     [I] filter to apply on stretching
 *   Colorkey     [I] colorkey
 *
 * RETURNS
 *   Success: D3D_OK, if we successfully load the pixel data into our surface or
 *                    if pSrcMemory is NULL but the other parameters are valid
 *   Failure: D3DERR_INVALIDCALL, if pDestSurface, SrcPitch or pSrcRect are NULL or
 *                                if SrcFormat is an invalid format (other than D3DFMT_UNKNOWN)
 *            D3DXERR_INVALIDDATA, if we fail to lock pDestSurface
 *            E_FAIL, if SrcFormat is D3DFMT_UNKNOWN or the dimensions of pSrcRect are invalid
 *
 * NOTES
 *   pSrcRect specifies the dimensions of the source data;
 *   negative values for pSrcRect are allowed as we're only looking at the width and height anyway.
