# SIP Communicator, the OpenSource Java VoIP and Instant Messaging client.
#
# Distributable under LGPL license.
# See terms of license at gnu.org.

# Note to translators:
# To translate SIP Communicator to your language
# - copy messages.properties to messages_xx.properties
#   (where xx is the ISO 639-1 language code of your language)
# - the file must use UTF-8 encoding
# - all entries are of the form key=translation, where only the
#   translation part has to be changed
# - {0}, {1}... are parameters which will be replaced by the
#   actual text at runtime, place them as you wish
# - you don't have to translate all entries, if an entry is not
#   found in your translation, the text in messages.properties will
#   be used
# - \ at the end of a line means that the translation is continued
#   in the next line
#
# To start SIP Communicator with a language that is different
# from your system's language, pass the language code to ant:
# ant -Duser.language=xx run
#
# The same rules apply to the properties files found in the other
# directories.
