# This is a template for the account.properties file. The account.properties
# file contains a list of protocol account initialization properties, such as

# and etc. The account.properties file MUST NOT be committed to CVS or shared
# among developers since that could lead to multiple login problems and cause
# testing to fail. You could create the file yourself using this template and
# setting all fields as indicated.
