# testing targets.

# you should copy this template to a new file called ./lib/testing.properties
# and then you can safely make changes to this personal copy. The build.xml
# testing targets expect you to provide this personal file.

# list all the tests that should be run by the test target of the project.
# n.b. if you do not want to run them all for some reason, be careful
#      how you mark your continuations and comments!
